# Experiment Factory Experiment

Hi Friend! This is an Experiment that is friendly for use in the [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory). Actually, it's intended to be run **within an fmri machine**
and so running the preview in the browser, you will see instructions to "press your Thumb" and similar that don't make sense for a keyboard. If you want a verison ready to go, we
provide a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/expfactory/cue-control-food/).

You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container. Check out the documentation above for more information, or [post an issue](https://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory/issues) if you have any questions.
